This project looks at observable trends in game development data. In-game purchasing data are analyzed with respect to user characteristics such as gender and age. 

In addition to player characteristics the project also oberserved purchasing trends within the user populations. The top spenders on in-game transactions were determined, along with which items were most popular and within which groups in the playerbase were they most popular. 

The first observable trend is that a majority of the playerbase making in-app purchases are males between the ages of 20 and 24. This demographic alone makes up almost half the gross revenue of all purchases, and this game is obviously a hit within this group. 

Another observable trend is correlation between the most purchased items and the most expensive items. The game seems to be priced and balanced in such a way that it encourages users to purchase the most expensive items. That is quite suprising given the huge range of prices of individual items as well as thier being almost 180 unique items for purchase. 

A final observation within the data is consistance across the data of purchases from each age bracket. Nearly all ages payed similar average amounts with respect to both the number of purchases within that age bracket and the number of people in that bracket. This demonstrates that each age bracket has similar tendancies to spend in the game, and there was no trend of specific age groups tending towards more or less expensive items. All measured groups had similar puchasing patterns.
